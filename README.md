# Idea of Project
This project presents a practical and innovative solution to one of the most dangerous problems faced by drivers today: drowsiness during driving. 
It aims to reduce road accidents caused by driver fatigue by developing a lightweight, wearable, and cost-effective drowsiness detection system. 
The core idea is to monitor eye movements using an IR proximity sensor mounted on personal eyeglasses, and to issue an immediate audio alert via a buzzer when signs of prolonged eye closure are detected. 
This mechanism provides a real-time safety feature for drivers, especially during long journeys or night shifts.
The concept is to build a non-intrusive, embedded system that operates autonomously without constant human supervision. 
By relying on minimal hardware and open-source development tools, the project ensures ease of replication, affordability, and widespread applicability. 
While the current implementation is simple, it lays a solid foundation for future enhancements such as integrating artificial intelligence for behavior analysis, heart rate sensors, or even emergency communication protocols.

# Components
Arduino Nano: The control unit that processes sensor data and triggers the alarm.
IR Proximity Sensor: Mounted near the eye on a personal glasses frame to detect eyelid closure.
Buzzer: Emits a loud alert sound to awaken the driver when drowsiness is detected.
Jumper Wires: Used to connect all electronic components on the breadboard.
Power Supply: External or battery-powered, enabling portable operation of the system.
